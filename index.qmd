Incoming MEDS students should follow the steps detailed in this [software installation guide](#install) *before* summer orientation -- there will be a dedicated troubleshooting session during orientation, should you need help completing any of the installations. 

Please carefully read through the [computing requirements & recommendations](#comp-reqs) section before deciding on what computer to purchase / use ahead of MEDS.
